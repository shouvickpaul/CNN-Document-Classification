Yukos owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft's purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets, said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.  Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale. \"]\nencoded_text = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(random_text)\ntest_text = pad_sequences(encoded_text, maxlen = max_length, padding= 'post')\nmodel.predict(test_text)","execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":15,"data":{"text/plain":"array([[9.9995697e-01, 1.8636454e-06, 2.4895855e-05, 1.8101961e-13,\n        1.6198514e-05]], dtype=float32)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"random_text = [\"Retirement age could be scrapped  The myth that ageing is a barrier to contributing to society needs to be exploded, the work and pensions minister has said.  This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said. It was also committed to stamping out age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.  Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was 'seriously considering' introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. Speaking at the London conference he said: Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination.  The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were increasingly consigned to the past. We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded. Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate.

The students are Kunal Deshmukh from Pune and Kritti Sharma from Panchkula, Haryana.The importance and uniqueness of this original discovery can be made out from the fact that it has been reported in the leading international journal 'Nature Astronomy' published from Britain. India's AstroSat/UVIT was able to achieve this unique feat because the background noise in the UVIT detector is much less than one on the Hubble Space Telescope of US-based NASA. Singh lauded India's Space Scientists for once again proving to the world that India's capability in Space technology has risen to a distinguished level from where our scientists are now offering cues and giving leads to the Space scientists in other parts of the world.IUCAA Director Somak Ray Chaudhury said: This discovery is a very important clue to how the dark ages of the Universe ended and there was light in the Universe. We need to know when this started, but it has been very hard to find the earliest sources of light.A noteworthy aspect is that AstroSat, which made this discovery, was launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on September 28, 2015, during the first term of the Modi government.It was developed by a team led by Shyam Tandon, Ex Emeritus Professor, IUCAA with the full support of ISRO.

The survey also found that as many as 74% of this workforce is ready to work remotely, either from cafes or their homes, as this saves their time and money. 80% feel that their jobs can be performed from a remote location instead of the office.

The survey was conducted across seven Indian metro cities during June and July with a sample size of 1,000. Another reason why working from home or remotely is popular is due to the amount of time saved by professionals in commuting to and from office.
